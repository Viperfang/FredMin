# FredMin - Ver 1.0

A super small and lightweight Server Administration Tool.
This powerful little beast will happily sit on the most restricted servers
in-house, or on the cloud.

*Just remember to put it in a password protected folder.

## Installation

- Add a sudo user WWW-DATA
enter SU to access root User
enter visudo
then add user to the sudoers file:
www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

- Dump it to a password protected folder

Have fun, and run with it!
